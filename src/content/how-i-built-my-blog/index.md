I created this blog to write posts about programming, front end development, technologies, etc. I connected this blog with my portfolio to have it all in one. My priority was to website be fast, modern, and simple to write posts.

### The stack

The base of my website is a Gatsby. As we know, Gatsby is a front end framework for creating dynamic pages. If you know React, Gatsby is super cool to build anything you can imagine.

So, to write this page, I used React and TypeScript. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, TypeScript is an open-source language that builds on JavaScript. This duo is modern and today's standard.

For my dynamic posts I used GraphQL - query language and Markdown Files to write my posts. It's simple to manage data from MD posts with GraphQL.

And of course, for styles I used SCSS, preprocessor which makes CSS a lot of easier and better.
