This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting! I'll write about programming, especially about React, Typescript, and Javascript. This blog also has to help me to learn new things.

### A little about me

I'm Adrian FrÄ…ckowiak and I'm 19 years old. Living in Poland and looking for my first job as a Front End Developer. Every day I learn new stuff in programming or web development. Create beautiful websites is my passion over the years.

I started with web development when I was 12-13 years old and I wanted to make my discussion forum about sport, games, etc. My first forums were developed with old phpBB. It was so satisfying, and I created a lot of websites like this.

After that, I had an experience with cs 1.6 servers. I made servers with forum and website, and in this time I learned photoshop. I forgot about programming and I went all in designing. I thought to be a web designer in the future, but when I was 17 I choose to be a web developer.

### Other hobbies

I enjoy board sports. It's also the way of my life, my wardrobe, etc, additionally, I cycle a lot. When you asked me about my favorite book or movie, it'll be Harry Potter. I can watch or read it several times. Wizarding World is amazing. Of course, I playing games, currently, my first position is CS:GO.
